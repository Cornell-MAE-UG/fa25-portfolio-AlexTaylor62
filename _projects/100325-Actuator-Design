Below is a picture of my design of a mechanism to lift a load.


Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your
choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear
actuator (pick from the online catalog, use max force values only), design a
frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height.
Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

I used a roller support to support my actuator. In this way, when the actuator extends it is drawn closer towards the pivot and allows for the rod AC to move into an almost vertical postion.
